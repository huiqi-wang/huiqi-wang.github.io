I am Huiqi Wang, currently a PhD student in Dr. Trevor Keenanâ€™s group at UC Berkeley. I am interested in understanding the key terrestrial ecosystem processes linking the water and carbon cycle, and how they would respond and feedback to future changing climate. Prior to PhD, I earned a B.S. in Water Resource and Hydraulic engineering at Tianjin University in 2018. I took a gap year after graduation, when I took internships both in research institutions and industry. Then I went to UC Berkeley in 2020 to study environmental fluid mechanics and hydrology and earned the M.S. in environmental engineering in 2021.
