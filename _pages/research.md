				<p>Water availability plays a large role in the global carbon, water and energy cycles, and limits ecosystem productivity in almost all biomes. 
				The SMAP project leverages information from NASAs soil moisture active-passive (SMAP) sensor within a model benchmarking framework, 
				combining both the carbon and water cycles to quantify the role of water in regulating global ecosystem state and function.

				<p>Limits on ecosystem productivity due to water availability manifest through constraints on the amount of biomass that can be sustained, 
				and on the amount of photosynthesis that can be maintained. These constraints are most evident in the world’s warm and arid environments, 
				where water plays the dominant role in primary production and where foliage cover, plant water use, and photosynthesis are all tightly coupled. 
				They are also evident in the world’s cold regions, however, where freeze-thaw states dictate landscape hydrology and water availability. 
				The consequences of changes in water availability on global ecosystems are thus potentially dramatic. 
				Understanding both the current constraint of water availability on ecosystem function, and the consequences of likely future changes, is therefore an urgent need -
				one that we aim to address.
