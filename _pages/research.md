I have been working on two research projects. One is to quantify the role of water in regulating global ecosystem state and function, combining both the carbon and water cycles. Another is to explore the application of machine learning-based emulator on improveing the current processed-based groundwater modeling.

Water availability plays a large role in the global carbon, water and energy cycles, and limits ecosystem productivity in almost all biomes. 
The SMAP project leverages information from NASAs soil moisture active-passive (SMAP) sensor within a model benchmarking framework, 
combining both the carbon and water cycles to quantify the role of water in regulating global ecosystem state and function.
